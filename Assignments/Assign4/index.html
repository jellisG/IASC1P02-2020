                        It's quite simple actually. While I currently don’t know of a way to grab text information from other websites, it is 
                        possible to supply myself with my own. There are several websites on the internet that let me copy paste famous quotes 
                        along with the original authors themselves. In code form, this involved making a variable which included an array of 
                        strings, containing a desired number of quotations that I grabbed from a quote generator online. The exact website I 
                        used was from this specific website <span class="keyword"><a href="https://miniwebtool.com/random-quote-generator/">here</a></span>. 
                        I looked for short one’s in particular since I didn’t want the website to look particularly cluttered. After grabbing all the quotations 
                        I wanted, I made a function which generates a random number based off the number of quotations in the array, which effectively 
                        allows me to grab a quote from a range without getting an error. With a press of a button, I can get a new random number 
                        and it will generate a new quote from the array each time the button is clicked on. It essentially looks for a given 
                        element in the HTML code and will insert a snippet of HTML in there through a JavaScript method. It will replace each 
                        time, which is the intention of generating a new quote.

                        Some Lorem Picsum pictures get deleted/removed throughout the years, so some random pictures
                        might end up blank and unviewable. However keep getting new pictures and you'll get four perfect pictures. 
                    </p>

                        This is a complex function. There is a website referred to as <span class="keyword"><a href="https://picsum.photos/">Lorem Picsum</a></span>, 
                        which contains a vast variety of images. This nifty website can obtain images in whatever desired resolutions you’d like, 
                        along with other decisions such as having grayscale images or blurred images. The special feature about this website is that 
                        it can be solely dependent on the properties of the URL. By inspection, there are numbers which will represent the resolution 
                        of the image as well as an ID. The ID of the image ranges from a certain number, so I have created yet another random number 
                        function. The difference compared to the previous function above is that when the button is pressed, it loads a new image directly 
                        from the website. The page does not reload either. By having a random number, we can grab the main segment of the Lorem Picsum website 
                        URL and insert our random number to represent our ID. With a different ID, means we will have a different picture, effectively giving 
                        us different pictures every time the button is clicked. By implementing the random number function, we therefore have randomly changing 
                        images.
