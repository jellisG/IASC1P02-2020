			<h1>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h1>
			<a name="whatIs"></a>
			<p><strong>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
				industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever
				since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled
				it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries,
				but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
				It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
				Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like
				Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</strong></p>

			<!-- 2nd Header with a paragraph in <em> styled text -->
			<h2>Why do we use it?</h2>
		  <a name="whyDo"></a>
			<p><em>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the
				readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using
				Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters,
				as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable
				English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem
				Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover
				many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over
				the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and
				the like).</em></p>
