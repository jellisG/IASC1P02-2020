				<h3>What are Membrane Keyboards?</h3>
			  <p class="smaller"> Taken From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_keyboard">Wikipedia</a> (Absolute Link)</p>
				<p>
					A membrane keyboard is a computer keyboard whose "keys" are not separate,
					moving parts, as with the majority of other keyboards, but rather are pressure
					pads that have only outlines and symbols printed on a flat, flexible surface.
					Very little, if any, tactile feedback is felt when using such a keyboard.
					Membrane keyboards work by electrical contact between the keyboard surface
					and the underlying circuits when keytop areas are pressed. <span class="font">These models
					were used with some early 1980s home computers</span>, enjoying wide adoption in
					consumer electronics devices. The keyboards are quite inexpensive to mass-produce,
					and are more resistant against dirt and liquids than most other keyboards.
					However, due to a low or non-existent tactile feedback, most people have
					difficulty typing with them, especially when larger numbers of characters
					are being typed

				<h3>What are Mechanical Keyboards?</h3>
				<p class="smaller"> Taken From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_technology#Mechanical-switch_keyboard">Wikipedia</a> (Absolute Link)</p>
				<p>
					Every key on a mechanical-switch keyboard contains a complete switch underneath.
					Each switch is composed of a housing, a spring, and a stem, and sometimes
					other parts such as a separate tactile leaf or a clickbar. Switches come
					in three variants: "linear" with consistent resistance, "tactile" with a
					non-audible bump, and "clicky" with both a bump and an audible click.
					Depending on the resistance of the spring, the key requires different amounts
					of pressure to actuate and to bottom out. The shape of the stem as well
					as the design of the switch housing varies the actuation distance and travel
					distance of the switch. The amount of sound produced by actuation can also
					be changed by the addition of rubber dampeners. Like other types of keyboards,
					mechanical keyboards allow for the removal and replacement of keycaps,
					but replacing them is more common with mechanical keyboards due to common
					stem shapes.

				<h3>Why Mechanical better than Membrane</h3>
				<p>
					For the everyday elite typist, mechanical keyboards have always been preferred
					over membrane keyboards. They certainly give a more premium/satisyfing feel, and are
					more customizable. Mechanical keyboards are can have a variety of sounds
					ranging from <span class="capital">"loud and clicky", "loud", and "smooth"</span>. They can also have a
					variety of different feelings when you press down on a key, such as "tactile
					bump" or "linear". The difference is the amount of actuation force until
					a key is pressed all the way down, where a "tactile and bump" requires initial
					force to press it down (a bump; where it then completely presses down),
					whereas a linear feel has consistent resistance and does not require enough
					force to hurdle over a "bump". Overall, membrane keyboards generally do
					not have these features, feel less stable and cannot simultaneously process
					the two key presses at the same time, which mechanical keyboards can do.
